# DISCLAIMER: This is an incomplete project. It is not ready for production use.

# Introduction

This is as bare bones as it gets for neural networks. I made a simple implemenation that has a NaN bug (for now). This network classifies a randomly generated set of spiral coordinates on a chart into three classes (RED, GREEN, BLUE). Once the implementation is fixed, I will add more features to this project. This may not look like much but it took me a while to figure out how to do this. I hope this helps someone else.

# How to use
